## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
The proposed solution is a dynamic web-based platform called SimuSelect, designed to simulate real-world selector-applicant interactions in a digital environment. This platform aims to replicate various selection processes such as job recruitment, college admissions, competitive program evaluations, and grant applications. It will feature two primary user roles: Applicants, who can create detailed profiles, submit applications, and participate in simulations such as tests, interviews, or group discussions; and Selectors, who can design custom evaluation criteria, conduct assessments, and simulate real-time decision-making processes. SimuSelect will offer interactive modules including AI-assisted mock interviews, customizable online tests, and scenario-based assessments to closely mimic real-life selection settings. The platform will also include dashboards for both applicants and selectors—enabling detailed feedback, performance insights, and ranking systems. Advanced analytics tools will allow selectors to simulate “what-if” scenarios, compare applicants based on different weightage criteria, and ensure data-driven decisions. The gamified user experience will keep applicants engaged through leaderboards and badges. Built using modern web technologies with optional AI integration, this platform will provide a scalable, fair, and efficient simulation tool to improve both selector training and applicant preparedness.
